  <h1>The Legend of The Wolf</h1>
  <p>
  Wolves are legendary because of their spine-tingling howl, 
  which they use to communicate. A lone wolf howls to attract the attention of 
  his pack, while communal howls may send territorial messages from one pack 
  to another. Some howls are confrontational. Much like barking domestic dogs, 
  wolves may simply begin howling because a nearby wolf has already begun.
